        <h3 class='Title'>Intelligent Agent - Based Model to Support Irrigation Management in Agricultural Crops</h3>
        <br/>
    
          <p>
            The aim of this Application web is to present the design and implementation of an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for the distribution of water in the large-scale irrigation and drainage district of Chicamocha and Firavitoba (Usochicamocha) in Boyacá - Colombia, where water is a common resource shared by many agents. Usochicamocha has eleven pumping stations distributed into 3641 ha and providing service for 4715 users. The fields used in this study belong to the San Rafael pumping station, which supplies water resources to 1054 fields. In the ABM proposed, each field or farm can be considered as a micro-level and a region or irrigation district as a macro-level. 

            The most approximated irrigation prescription at each micro-level allows determining the water needs at the macro-level, as a reference for the negotiation of water distribution. A Geographical Information System (GIS) was used to manage georeferenced field information. Field capacity and the permanent wilting point of the studied soils, initial soil moisture, crop types, and planting dates were incorporated into the ABM model for determining crop coefficients. Values of crop evapotranspiration were determined using crop coefficients and reference evapotranspiration obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and weather station data. Each simulated day, the ABM autonomously prescribes the irrigation amounts and timing for all the fields. The results obtained can be extended to other pumping irrigation regions and it is a novel decision-making support for water resources management applications with multiple stakeholders.
